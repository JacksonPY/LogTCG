# PokeLogger - Python 3.10
Log your pokemon cards locally. Hello! I wanted to make a nice little logging system for a friend who collects Pokemon cards. I suggested to use excel or sheets due to it storing on an external server...however I wanted the challenge as I have never used the SQLite module that is baked into python. I plan to continue updating this as inspiration comes to me! This project is very simple as it is my first time working with SQLite in Python.



# Installation
